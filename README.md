# Theta Virtual try-on Example

This project provides a working Virtual try-on example using [Theta Edge Cloud](https://www.thetaedgecloud.com). It is implemented using React and Vite.<br><br>


## Getting Started

1. Configure your Virtual try-on project by editing the variable in the file `.env`. See [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) if you don't have an API URL.

```bash
VITE_API_URL : the inference endpoint generated with your Theta Edge Cloud dashboard.
```

<br>

2. Run the following commands to install the project dependencies and start it locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

<br>

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need an API URL from Theta EdgeCloud.
You can get it by deploying a Viton model on Theta EdgeCloud [Model Explorer](https://www.thetaedgecloud.com/dashboard/ai/service/model-explorer).
